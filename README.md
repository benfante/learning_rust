# Learning Rust

Exercises during my learning of the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

## Installing Rust

While you can try Rust online using the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/), it's recommended to install Rust on your local machine for a better learning experience.

To install Rust, follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). The recommended way is to use `rustup`, the Rust toolchain installer.

Briefly, you can install Rust by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

After installation, you can verify that Rust is installed correctly by checking the version:

```sh
rustc --version
```

This should display the installed version of Rust.

## Setting Up the development Environment

To set up your development environment for Rust, you can use any text editor or IDE that supports Rust. Some popular choices include:

- Visual Studio Code with the Rust extension
- IntelliJ IDEA with the Rust plugin
- Sublime Text with Rust packages
- Vim or Neovim with Rust plugins

I recommend using Visual Studio Code with the Rust extension for a good balance of features and ease of use.

The recommended Rust extension for Visual Studio Code is called "rust-analyzer". You can install it from the Extensions marketplace in Visual Studio Code.

You can follow [these instructions](<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust>) to set up Visual Studio Code for Rust development.
